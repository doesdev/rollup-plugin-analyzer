  Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)
  It's a wonder man can eat at all
  When things are big that should be small
  Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
  And I'm giving all my love to this world
  Only to be told
  I can't see
  I can't breathe
  No more will we be
  And nothing's going to change the way we live
  'Cause we can always take but never give
  And now that things are changing for the worse,
  See, its a crazy world we're living in
  And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
  Is all we have to give these
  Futures made of virtual insanity now
  Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
  For useless, twisting, our new technology
  Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
  And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
  Hard to know where to begin
  If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
  And now every mother, can choose the color
  Of her child
  That's not nature's way
  Well that's what they said yesterday
  There's nothing left to do but pray
  I think it's time I found a new religion
  Whoa, it's so insane
  To synthesize another strain
  There's something in these
  Futures that we have to be told
  Futures made of virtual insanity now
  Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
  For useless, twisting, our new technology
  Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
  Now there is no sound
  If we all live underground
  And now it's virtual insanity
  Forget your virtual reality
  Oh, there's nothing so bad
  I know yeah
  Of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in
  Has got to change, yeah
  Things, will never be the same
  And I can't go on
  While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
  Oh, this world, has got to change
  'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on, it was virtual
  Virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
  That virtual insanity is what it is
  Futures made of virtual insanity now
  Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
  For useless, twisting, our new technology
  Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
  Futures made of virtual insanity now
  Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
  For useless, twisting, our new technology
  Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
  Living, virtual insanity
  Living, virtual insanity
  Living, virtual insanity
  Living, virtual insanity
  Virtual insanity is what we're living in
